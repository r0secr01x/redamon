# Data Export & Import

RedAmon provides multiple ways to export scan data, back up projects, and import previously exported projects. This page covers all export and import capabilities.

## Scan Data Downloads

Each scanning module produces downloadable results from the Graph Dashboard toolbar:

| Module | Format | Button Location | Filename |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Reconnaissance** | JSON | Recon Actions group (blue) > Download icon | `recon_{projectId}.json` |
| **GVM Vulnerability Scan** | JSON | GVM group (red) > Download icon | `gvm_{projectId}.json` |
| **GitHub Secret Hunt** | JSON | GitHub Hunt group (orange) > Download icon | `github_hunt_{projectId}.json` |

Download buttons only appear after the respective scan has completed.

## Data Table Export

The **Data Table** view (accessible via the "Data Table" tab on the Graph Dashboard) supports Excel export:

1. Switch to **Data Table** view using the view tabs below the toolbar
2. Optionally filter the data using the search bar
3. Click the **Export to XLSX** button
4. An Excel file downloads containing all visible rows and columns

This exports all graph nodes in a flat table format with sortable columns.

## AI Agent Session Export

You can export any AI agent conversation as a Markdown report:

1. Open the **AI Agent Drawer** on the Graph Dashboard
2. Load the conversation you want to export (or use the current one)
3. Click the **download icon** in the drawer header
4. A `.md` file downloads containing:
   - All user messages and agent responses
   - Thinking/reasoning steps
   - Tool executions with output
   - Findings and recommendations
   - Todo list states

## Project Export

Export an entire project as a ZIP archive for backup or migration:

1. Go to the **Projects** page
2. Click on the project card to open its settings
3. Click the **Export** button
4. A ZIP file downloads containing:
   - Project configuration (all 180+ settings)
   - Conversation history with all messages
   - Neo4j graph data (all nodes and relationships)
   - Artifact files (scan results JSON files)

---

## Project Import

Import a previously exported project:

1. Go to the **Projects** page
2. Click the **Import Project** button
3. Select the ZIP file from a previous export
4. The project is recreated with all its data:
   - Configuration settings are restored
   - Conversations are recreated
   - Graph nodes and relationships are re-imported
   - Artifacts are restored

> **Note:** On import, a new project ID is generated. The imported project will not conflict with existing projects even if the original still exists.

## Neo4j Direct Access

For advanced users, the Neo4j graph database is directly accessible:

- **Browser UI:** `http://localhost:7474` — Neo4j's built-in web interface for running Cypher queries
- **Bolt protocol:** `bolt://localhost:7687` — for programmatic access from scripts or applications

**Default credentials:** `neo4j` / password from your `.env` file (`NEO4J_PASSWORD`, default: `changeme123`)
