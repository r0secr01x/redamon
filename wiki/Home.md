## What is RedAmon?

RedAmon is an AI-powered agentic red team framework that automates offensive security operations — from reconnaissance to exploitation to post-exploitation — with zero human intervention. Everything runs inside Docker containers: no security tools needed on your host machine.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Automated Reconnaissance** — 6-phase scanning pipeline that maps an entire attack surface
- **AI-Powered Pentesting** — autonomous agent that reasons, selects tools, and executes exploits
- **Network Vulnerability Scanning** — GVM/OpenVAS integration with 170,000+ NVTs
- **GitHub Secret Hunting** — discover leaked credentials and API keys
- **Attack Surface Graph** — Neo4j knowledge graph with 17 node types
- **180+ Project Settings** — fine-grained control over every tool and behavior
- **400+ AI Models** — support for 5 providers including local models via Ollama
