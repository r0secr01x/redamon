# User Management

RedAmon supports multiple users, each with their own set of projects. Users are created and managed from the **Projects** page (`/projects`).

---

## Creating a User

When you first open RedAmon, the left panel of the Projects page shows the user management area.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the **Projects** page (click "Projects" in the top navigation bar, or go to `http://localhost:3000/projects`)

2. In the left panel, you'll see a **"Create User"** section with two fields:
   - **Name** — your display name (e.g., "John Doe")
   - **Email** — your email address (must be unique across all users)

3. Fill in both fields and click the **"Create"** button

4. The new user appears in the user list below

> **Note:** Users are stored locally in the PostgreSQL database. There is no authentication system — users are simply used to organize and isolate projects.

---

## Switching Between Users

If you have multiple users:

1. Go to the **Projects** page
2. Click on any user in the user list (left panel)
3. The project grid on the right updates to show only that user's projects
4. The selected user is remembered across browser sessions (stored in `localStorage`)

---

## Deleting a User

To delete a user:

1. Go to the **Projects** page
2. Hover over the user you want to delete in the user list
3. Click the **delete icon** (trash can) that appears
4. Confirm the deletion

> **Warning:** Deleting a user also deletes all their projects and associated data (reconnaissance results, graph data, AI agent conversations). This action cannot be undone.

---

## How Users Work

- Each user has a unique email address
- Projects belong to exactly one user
- All reconnaissance data, graph nodes, and AI agent conversations are scoped to a user + project combination
- The currently selected user is persisted in your browser's `localStorage` (`redamon-current-user`), so it survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- When you navigate to the Graph page, operations run under the currently selected user

## Next Steps

Once you have a user created, you're ready to **[create your first project](3.-Creating-a-Project)**.
