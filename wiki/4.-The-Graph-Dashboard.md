# The Graph Dashboard

The **Graph Dashboard** (`/graph`) is the primary interface of RedAmon. This is where you visualize your attack surface, launch scans, interact with the AI agent, and explore findings. This page gives you a complete tour of every element on screen.

---

## Accessing the Graph Dashboard

1. Select a project from the **Project Selector** dropdown in the top navigation bar (or navigate from the Projects page)
2. Click **"Red Zone"** in the top navigation bar (the crosshair icon)
3. You'll land on the Graph page with your selected project loaded

| **Phase Badge** | Current agent phase (Informational / Exploitation / Post-Exploitation) with phase-specific color |
| **Step Counter** | Current iteration number of the agent |
| **AI Agent Button** | Toggle the AI Agent drawer open/closed |

---

## View Tabs

Just below the toolbar, two tabs let you switch views:

| Tab | Icon | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Graph Map** | Waypoints | The interactive graph visualization (default) |
| **Data Table** | Table | A searchable, sortable table of all nodes |

When in **Data Table** mode, additional controls appear:
- **Search input** — filter rows by any text
- **Row count** — shows filtered vs. total rows
- **Export to XLSX** — download the entire table as an Excel file

---

## Graph Canvas

The graph canvas is the main visualization area where your attack surface is displayed as an interactive node-link diagram.

### 2D Mode

<!-- Screenshot: 06-graph-2d.png — 2D graph view showing interconnected nodes (Domain, Subdomain, IP, Port, etc.) with labels and color coding -->
![2D Graph View](images/06-graph-2d.png)

- **Pan**: Click and drag the background
- **Zoom**: Mouse scroll wheel
- **Select node**: Click on any node to open the Node Drawer
- Nodes are **color-coded** by type (see Bottom Bar)
- Nodes are positioned by a force-directed layout algorithm

### 3D Mode

<!-- Screenshot: 07-graph-3d.png — 3D WebGL graph view with rotatable perspective showing nodes floating in 3D space -->
![3D Graph View](images/07-graph-3d.png)

- **Rotate**: Click and drag
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag
- **Zoom**: Mouse scroll wheel
- **Select node**: Click on any node
- Provides a more immersive view for large graphs

### Auto-Refresh

During active reconnaissance, the graph **auto-refreshes every 5 seconds** to show new nodes as they're discovered. The refresh stops when the scan completes.

---

## Data Table

<!-- Screenshot: 08-data-table.png — Data table view showing rows of nodes with columns for type, name, and properties, plus the search bar and export button -->
![Data Table](images/08-data-table.png)

The data table provides a flat, searchable view of all nodes in the graph:

- **Columns**: Node type, name, and key properties
- **Row expansion**: Click a row to see all properties in detail
- **Global search**: Filter across all columns
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort
- **Excel export**: Download the entire dataset as `.xlsx`

---

## Bottom Bar (Node Legend & Filter)

The bottom bar displays a **scrollable row of color-coded chips**, one for each node type present in the graph.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Color chips** | Each node type has a distinct color matching the graph |
| **Count badges** | Shows how many nodes of each type exist |
| **Click to filter** | Click a chip to show/hide that node type on the graph |
| **All / None** | Quick actions to show all or hide all node types |

This is especially useful for large graphs where you want to focus on specific node types (e.g., only Vulnerabilities and CVEs).

---

## Node Drawer

When you click on a node in the graph (or a row in the data table), the **Node Drawer** slides in from the left.

<!-- Screenshot: 17-node-drawer.png — The Node Drawer showing a selected node with its type badge, name, ID, and all properties listed -->
![Node Drawer](images/17-node-drawer.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type badge** | Color-coded label showing the node type (e.g., "Subdomain", "Vulnerability") |
| **Node ID** | The internal identifier |
| **Node name** | The display name (e.g., domain name, IP address, CVE ID) |
| **Properties** | All properties of the node, formatted and labeled |
| **Delete button** | Only shown for Exploit nodes — allows removing a specific exploit record |

> Internal fields like `project_id` and `user_id` are hidden automatically.

---

## Logs Drawer

During any active scan (Recon, GVM, or GitHub Hunt), a **Logs Drawer** slides in from the right showing real-time output.

<!-- Screenshot: 11-recon-logs.png — The Logs Drawer open during a reconnaissance scan, showing the current phase, progress indicator, and streaming log messages -->
![Recon Logs](images/11-recon-logs.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Phase indicator** | Shows the current scanning phase (e.g., "Phase 2: Port Scanning") |
| **Phase number** | Progress through the pipeline |
| **Log messages** | Real-time streaming of scan output |
| **Clear button** | Clear the current log display |

Each scan type (Recon, GVM, GitHub Hunt) has its own independent logs drawer, toggled by the respective "Logs" button in the toolbar.

---

## AI Agent Drawer

The AI Agent drawer is the most feature-rich panel. It provides a full chat interface for interacting with the autonomous AI agent. See the dedicated **[AI Agent Guide](8.-AI-Agent-Guide)** for a complete walkthrough.
